I collaborated this homework on the first half with Zhihang Yuan - zhyuan1@seas.upenn.edu under the collaboration policy at https://interactive-fiction-class.org/.

This is a mini text-based adventure game called Bug knight. The main story is about the player's imaginary experience of debugging computer program with epic fights and looping through different world. The main inspiration for this story comes from the slightly tedious and lengthy debug process that I keep encountering in my studies. And I often space out during this process and imagine how cool it would be if there are dragons, spaceships and swords etc. involved. So, I've written this little story, which packs in some of my favorite game settings and memes. Hope you enjoy playing!
